Camel news is an implementation of Lamer news
(https://github.com/antirez/lamernews) written using Perl.  At the
moment it is compatible with the redis structure used by Lamer news
0.9.2.

I wrote this just for fun as an excuse to read the lamernews code to
learn a bit more about redis (and ruby).  I've no idea how long I'll
continue to work on it but it partly depends on whether anyone is
crazy enough to use it.

Some of the code in this repository is taken directly from the
original lamernews code base.  That retains the original copyright
and license.

software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same
terms as the Perl 5 programming language system itself.
